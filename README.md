# Simple Todo App

This is an app where users can add items with optional due dates to a list and check them off as the items are completed.

## Functionality

The users are able to click the "add Todo" button. A form will be generarted that allows them to input a brief description of the task that needs to be completed along with an optional due date. The user can then click the "Create" button and the task along with its due date will be displayed at the bottom of the list of Todo items, if there was no due date added the field will be blank. The user can than click the check box to indicate that the task has been completed. The user can also rearrange the list by using the delete button to remove task that have been completed.

## Technology

HTML, CSS, and Javascript were used to create this app. Object Oriented Programming was used to refactor the Javascript code so that there is no repetitive hard coding and using the "this" key word to generalize across classes when functions are called.
